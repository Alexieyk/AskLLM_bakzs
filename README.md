## Introduction

AskLLM is a sophisticated conversational system designed to offer a user-friendly interaction experience through the application of natural language processing and artificial intelligence technologies. The system leverages deep learning models to process and understand user inputs, providing a range of functionalities such as extracting phone numbers from text, checking phone bills, and status inquiries, among others.

## Getting Started

To get the AskLLM project up and running, ensure that your environment is set up with all the necessary dependencies, including a Python environment and required libraries (e.g., `torch`, `gradio`, `pandas`, etc.).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local environment:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-URL>
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd AskLLM
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies (if a `requirements.txt` file is available):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Execute `main.py` to launch the project:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Project Architecture

The AskLLM project consists of several modules, each responsible for a specific aspect of the system's functionality:

- `main.py`: The entry point of the project, responsible for initializing the system and handling user inputs.
- `agent.py`: Defines the logic for interacting with users and processing requests.
- `chatbot.py`: Communicates with external APIs to obtain responses generated by models.
- `log_wrapper.py`: Handles logging, aiding developers in tracking and debugging.
- `phone_utils.py`: Offers utility functions related to phone numbers, such as bill and status checks.
- `bill_check.py` & `status_check.py`: Modules dedicated to specific functionalities, handling the logic for bill and status checks respectively.
- `chat.py`: Manages the chat logic with users.
- `common.py`: Defines common utilities and tools used across the project.

## Writing Your Own Agent

To extend the AskLLM project with your own intelligent agents, follow these steps:

1. Create a new Python file in the `agents` directory.
2. Define your agent class, inheriting from the base class if provided, or creating a new one with necessary methods.
3. Implement the logic for processing user inputs and generating responses within your agent class.
4. Integrate your agent into the main system by importing and utilizing it within `main.py` or the appropriate module.

Ensure your agent adheres to the system's interaction and response protocols for seamless integration.

## Configuration

To configure the AskLLM project according to your needs, consider the following:

- Update `config.py` (if present) with relevant parameters such as API keys, model settings, and other configurable options.
- Adjust the environment settings, such as Python version and dependencies, as required by your project's specific needs.
- Modify the `main.py` or other relevant files to integrate new agents, features, or functionalities into the system.
